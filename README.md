#Introduction
These days, more and more people are suffering from sleep deprivation. There are many reports saying that sleep deprivation will give negative effects on health. 
According to Korea Gallup REport in 2017, sleep deprivation will increase risk of cardiovascular disease 8 times, risk of diabetes 5 times, risk of dementia 5 times, etc.
Also according to National Helath Insurance Service in South Korea, the number of patients with sleeping disorders increased from 2014 to 2018 fastly. Our team speculates that this trends continued in 2020. 

Due to the advance of technology such as introduction of mobile phones, and computers, this trend continued and will be in the future. Although people are sleeping less due to their hard working styles with a belif in good human nature, our team bet that most people are sleeping less because they got distracted by cell phones or internet. Especially this is a major prolbme for many people who needs to go to specific places such as school or jobs at the certain time in the morning. According to National Sleep Foundation, the minimum required sleeping hours is at least 6 unless you are older than 65 years old. In other words, from Monday to Friday (unless you go to work on Saturday), you need to sleep at elast 30 hours for 5 days. 
To fix this problem, our team thought that what many people need is mom. Mom who cares about your health, who tells you to go to bed, who wakes you up in the morning. 
With this ideation of mom, our team developed Mommybot. 

Mommybot's main function is divided into three: Record time events, Monitors your bed, Actions.
